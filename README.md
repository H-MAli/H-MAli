Hello! I'm Mohammad Ali Haghshenas, a seasoned DevOps Engineer hailing from Tehran, Iran. With over a decade of hands-on experience, I have honed my skills across a multitude of technologies and platforms such as .NET (MAUI & WPF), PHP (Laravel & Symphony), JavaScript (NodeJS & React), and Python (Django).

In recent years, I've taken a keen interest in Machine Learning and Cryptography. I'm currently exploring these fields by experimenting with tools like NumPy and Matplotlib. My broad technical acumen extends to network design and administration, with specialization in Docker, virtualization, and IPv4/IPv6 networking.

I co-founded [doopapps.com](https://doopapps.com), a business venture specializing in mobile and web solutions for mid-sized enterprises. I am also engaged in various other roles, ranging from IT administration to technical coordination in the telecommunication sector. My commitment to continuous learning and innovation is evident from my ongoing projects and a proven track record of solving complex technical challenges.

I welcome collaboration and knowledge exchange. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mohammad-ali-haghshenas-367316137) or reach out via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/your_twitter_handle).
