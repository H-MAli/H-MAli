Hi!
My name's Ali and I'm a long-term lover of `.NET`! I've been coding since 2010-ish, and besides `.NET`, I have a long history with `php` (mostly `laravel`), `javascript` (mostly `react`), and a little bit of `python` (mostly `django`).
My current enthusiasm are ML and Crypto, and I've been fiddling around with some `numpy` and `matplotlib` stuff as of late.
I'm really looking forward with any collaboration. Please reach me through [my twitter](https://twitter.com/H_MAli).
Cheers!
